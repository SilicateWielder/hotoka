# hotoka
A personal discord bot that I've written for use in my own discord server. This is primarily meant to be a private-use bot for now, though I may allow other people to use it in the future.

For now it's quite basic, and I'm primarily focusing on the core architecture for the bot so that it's easily expandable and I can avoid the pitfalls I ran into with Guildleus/Guildmeister.

## Roadmap

 - Module functionality (Pending)
 - Database module (Pending)
